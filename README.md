The web app will enable the user(distributor) to 
- create orders(print invoices, sales orders..) 
- store product information, inventory
- store client information and 
- view a history of conversations made with the client and orders made by the client in a timeline fashion for CRM. 
<br/>
An approval workflow involving manager, salesperson, financier and warehousing will be developed to generate details inside of the order including sales order , invoices , payments ledger,
I will try to deploy the web application in the form of a micro services architecture. 
Could you suggest to me some of your requirements or problems faced in this area so that I can solve them and incorporate new features in my application?
